VBA Challenge Module 2
This was a terrible experience that i would never put any real world application to in Excel/VBA. SQLite or any DBMS would have been a more enjoyable and thought provoking approach. Perhaps VBA to consolidate data with the same schema into a single spreadsheet page, then a process to insert or update a DB and perform a similar analysis can be incorporated in the future? I hope :) because i did not like this.

I also did not finish :)
